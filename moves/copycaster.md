# Copycaster
When you are **the first spell-casting member of your party to use magic where this foe can sense it** they gain the ability to cast a spell from your class, roll+WIS. On a 10+, the GM will choose a level 1 spell from your class. On a 7-9 the same, but the spell must be of your level or greater. On a 6-the GM will choose a spell from your class of any level.

>Your power betrays you!
