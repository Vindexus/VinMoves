# Volatile Growths
While in the presence of this enemy, for every 6 you roll when making a move, you can either keep the 6 or reroll it. If you keep the 6 this enemy grows 1 pulsing nodule that seethes with magical energy. When this enemy dies its nodules explode in a cascade of magical energy, anyone caught in the blast must roll+CON and subtract the number of nodules that exploded. On a 10+ you are unaffected, on a 7-9 choose 1, on a 6- the GM will also choose one.

 - You take b[2d8] damage
 - You gain a new debility of your choice
 - Something you carry, the GM will tell you what, is destroyed

>Not yet! Let me run away first, then shoot it.
