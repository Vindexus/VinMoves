# Spelleater
When this foe **feeds off the energy created when you cast a spell**, it opens its mouth and sucks that energy into its body, roll+INT. On a 10+ choose one, on a 7-9 choose two. On a 6- the GM will choose two:

 - It uses the power it siphoned to heal itself for 1d8
 - The power charges its next attack, which deals +1d10 damage forward if it lands
 - This interference drains your mind, take 1d8 damage ignoring armor
 - The power is redirected to two allies you name, they take 2d4 damage ignoring armor
 - You forget the spell
