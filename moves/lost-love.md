# Lost Love
When you are **the first party member to make physical contact with this foe**, you get a vision of something terrible that happened to a loved one in their past, roll+CHA. On a 10+ choose two, on a 7-9 choose one:

 - You get a clear sense of that person, the GM will tell you their name and describe them
 - You know what happened to them, describe it
 - You know who or what was responsible, the GM will tell you
 
On a 7+, take +1 forward when acting on the information.

>Tis better to have lost and avenged than to never have loved at all.
