# Chain Lightning
When you are **struck by this enemy's chain lightning attack**, its power rampages through you before attempting to jump targets, take their damage and roll+CON. **On a 10+** you absorb the entirety of the attack and it does not jump targets. **On a 7-9** the lightning uses its remaining power to deal damage to a party member of your choice, but it does not continue to jump. **On a 6-** the lightning courses from you to another party member of the GM's choice and triggers this move on them.
