The <strong>first time this enemy’s blood touches you</strong> it binds its life force to yours, roll+CHA. On a 7+ whenever it takes damage, you take the same amount ignoring armor and describe how this damage manifests itself.<br />' +
    ' On a 10+ the link works both ways; when you take damage so does this enemy.<br />' +
    'On a 6- this link affects not just you – pick a party member you have a Bond with to be affected in the same way.</p>' +
  '<p>This effect lasts about a day unless the enemy is killed or you find some way to break the link.</p>',
