# Illusionary Defense
When this enemy first feels itself threatened it creates two near-identical copies of itself. These copies deal the same damage, but have half the enemy's current health and no armor. If you are **the party member who got the best look at this enemy**, roll+WIS. On a 10+ you know what to look for to distinguish the two illusions, describe the tell. On a 7-9 the same, but only one of the illusions has this tell.

>Illusions! Tricks are something witches do for coin.
