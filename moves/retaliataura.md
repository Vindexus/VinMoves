# Retaliataura
When you **deal 7 or more damage to this enemy in a single attack**, the shimmering aura around it crackles and lashes out with tendrils of arcane energy at you and anyone with reach range of you. If **you are caught in the counter-attack** describe how you defy it and roll+STAT. On a 10+  you avoid the attack entirely. On a 7-9 choose 1. On a 6- the GM will also choose one:

 - You take the damage that activated the aura
 - The damage required to activate this aura is reduced by 1
 - The enemy negates the damage. This can only be taken once per counter-attack
