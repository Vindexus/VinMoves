# Snake's Window
When you **roll double 1s in the le 1s in the presence of this foe** it finds an opening into your mind â€“ it catches glimpses of what you're about to do almost before you know you're going to do it. This effect lasts until the foe is defeated, someone else rolls double 1s, or you find some way to break the spell.

>The eyes are the gates of the mind, and you have left yours unguarded.
