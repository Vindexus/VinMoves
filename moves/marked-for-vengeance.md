# Marked for Vengeance

When you **deal the final blow to this foe** it lashes out with its final breath and marks your body. A symbol materializes on you that those it is in league with will be able to detect from miles away. Describe the mark and what form it takes (tattoo, scar, brand, etc) and roll+CON.

 - On a 10+ the mark will itch when those that can detect it are within a mile or so of you
 - On a 7-9 the mark will cause a minor burning pain when they are almost right on top of you
 - On a 6- the mark will pulse with a searing agony when they are within reach of you and you will take -1 forward

This mark can be removed, but itâ€™s a difficult process that is beyond the skill of most healers and magic users.

>You won't get far, I will be avenged!
