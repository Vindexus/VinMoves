# Venom Attack
When you **take damage after armor from this foe for the first time**, the venom seeps into your veins, roll+CON. On a 10+ you fight off the effects of the venom. On a 7-9 you aren't so lucky, choose one. On a 6- the GM will also choose one:

 - It saps the strength from you, take -1d6 damage forward
 - It burns in your body, take 1d6 damage ignoring armor
 - The pain shakes your focus, take -1 forward

>Stay wary of its limbs, the green shite holds a nasty burn!
