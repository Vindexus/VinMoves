# Spellshifter
This enemy has the ability to morph spells cast in its presence. When **this foe attempts to mutate a spell you've just cast** roll+WIS. On a 10+, your spell has the desired effect, but it looks entirely different, describe how. On a 7-9 choose another spell you have prepared, it will be cast instead and on the same target. On a 6- the same, but the GM will choose.
