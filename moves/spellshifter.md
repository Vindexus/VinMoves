# Spellshifter
This enemy has the ability to morph spells cast in its presence. When **this foe attempts to mutate a spell you've just cast** roll+WIS. On a 10+, your spell has the desired effect, but it looks entirely different, describe how. On a 7-9 choose another spell you have prepared, it will be cast instead and on the same target. If you have no other spells prepared treat a 7-9 as a miss. On a 6- the GM will choose a spell from your class of your level+1 or lower.

>Shift and shimmer, twist and turn, bless your friend and your friend might burn!
