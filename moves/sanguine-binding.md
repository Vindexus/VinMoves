# Sanguine Binding
This enemy has the power to use its blood to create a link between it and you. The **first time this enemy's blood touches you** it binds its life force to yours, roll+CHA. On a 7+ whenever it takes damage, take the same amount ignoring armor and describe how this damage manifests itself. On a 10+ the link works both ways; when you take damage so does this enemy. On a 6- this link affects not just you â€“ pick a party member you have a Bond with to be affected in the same way.

This effect lasts about a day unless the enemy is killed or you find some way to break the link.
