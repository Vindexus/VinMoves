# Volatile Growths
While in the presence of this enemy, **every time you get a 6 on a die while rolling a move** you can either keep the 6 or reroll that die. If you keep the 6 this enemy develops 1 pulsing growth on their body that seethes with magical energy. When this enemy dies its growths explode in a cascade of magical energy, if you are **caught in the blast** roll+CON and subtract the number of growths that exploded. On a 10+ you are unaffected, on a 7-9 choose 1, on a 6- the GM will also choose one.

 - You take b[2d8] damage
 - You gain a new debility of your choice
 - Something you carry, the GM will tell you what, is destroyed

>Not yet! Let me run away first, then shoot it.
