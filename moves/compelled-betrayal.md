# Compelled Betrayal
When this enemy manipulates your mind so **you think another member of your party is your sworn enemy** you can either succumb to the spell or rebel against it. If you **fight off the effect**, roll+WIS. On a 10+ choose 1, on a 7-9 choose 2, on a 6- choose 2 in addition to what the GM says:

 - It causes considerable mental pain, take 1d8 damage ignoring armor
 - You gain the Confused debility
 - You gain the Stunned debility
 - You must concentrate, and open yourself up to attack, the GM will tell you how

If you **succumb to the compulsion and attack your ally** you both mark XP and you roll+Bond with them. On a 10+ choose two, on a 7-9 choose one, on a 6- the GM will choose one:

 - You manage to call out a warning
 - The effect ends immediately if you take damage
 - The effect ends immediately if you deal damage to them
 - The effect will end after about a minute
