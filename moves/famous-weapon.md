# Famous Weapon
When your group **first hears of or sees this enemy's notorious weapon**, the party member with the most knowledge of weapons knows of it and rolls+INT. On a 7+ choose two and describe them:

 - It's said to leave lasting wounds beyond cuts and bruises
 - It crackles or shimmers with an elemental force
 - It is a sentient weapon with a mind of its own
 - It is holy (or corrupt)
 - It is a long lost weapon of a famous order, guild, or family
 - It was constructed using a rare and powerful material

On a 10+ the GM will tell you what tags, bonuses, and additional effects the weapon has.  
On a 6- the GM will choose two, but the weapon will not easily serve a new master.
