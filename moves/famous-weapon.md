# Famous Weapon
When this **enemy brandishes their notorious weapon to the group**, the party member with the highest Intelligence score recognizes it and rolls+INT. On a 7+ choose two and describe them:

 - It's said to leave lasting wounds beyond cuts and bruises
 - It crackles or shimmers with an elemental force
 - It is a sentient weapon with a mind of its own
 - It is holy (or corrupt)
 - It is a long lost weapon of a famous order, guild, or family
 - It was constructed using a rare and powerful material'

On a 10+ the GM will tell you what tags, bonuses, and additional effects the weapon has.
